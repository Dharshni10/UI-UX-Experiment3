## Aim:
To apply Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App.

## Algorithm:
1. Start

2. Select the target app (Netflix)

3. Identify competitor apps or websites

4. Define heuristic evaluation principles

5. Evaluate Netflix based on each heuristic

6. Identify and record usability issues

7. Assign severity ratings to each issue

8. Compare findings with competitor apps

9. Suggest possible improvements

10. Document all observations and analysis

11. Conclude the evaluation

12. End

## Output:

### Heuristic Evaluation Report – Zomato

This report presents a heuristic evaluation of the Zomato application and compares it with two major competitors—Swiggy and Uber Eats.
The goal is to identify usability strengths and weaknesses and recommend improvements to enhance the overall user experience.

### 1. Objective

The objective of this heuristic evaluation is to analyze the Zomato app’s user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and compare it with competing food delivery platforms.
This helps in identifying usability gaps and proposing design changes to improve customer satisfaction and ease of use.

### 2. Competitors Selected

The evaluation compares Zomato with Swiggy and Uber Eats based on similar functionality, audience, and service offerings in the food delivery domain.

### 3. Methodology

A heuristic evaluation was conducted based on Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, focusing on aspects such as visibility of system status, consistency, user control, error prevention, and aesthetic design.
Each app was examined across its core user flow—searching for restaurants, adding items to the cart, and completing an order—to identify usability issues and design strengths.

### 4. Evaluation Criteria

The main heuristics considered in this study are:

Visibility of System Status

Consistency and Standards

User Control and Freedom

Error Prevention

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

### 5. Heuristic Evaluation Summary

| **Heuristic**                       | **Zomato**                                                                             | **Swiggy**                                       | **Uber Eats**                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Visibility of System Status**     | Real-time updates for delivery, but ETA not always accurate.                           | Smooth live tracking with step indicators.       | ETA shown clearly but sometimes loads slowly.                |
| **Consistency and Standards**       | Consistent colors and icons, but checkout layout changes across screens.               | Very consistent interface; standard icons.       | Consistent design but minor label inconsistencies.           |
| **User Control and Freedom**        | Limited undo options while editing cart items.                                         | Easy to remove or modify items.                  | Allows quick undo of recent actions.                         |
| **Error Prevention**                | Sometimes confirms wrong address; “Place Order” button too close to quantity controls. | Good address validation, few accidental actions. | Occasionally repeats payment failure without proper warning. |
| **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** | Visually appealing dark-red theme but overloaded with offers and banners.              | Clean, simple, less visual clutter.              | Balanced but too many promotional pop-ups.                   |


### 6. Key Findings

Zomato provides a strong visual identity and clear navigation but suffers from information overload due to excessive banners and pop-ups.

Swiggy performs best overall in consistency and clarity, offering smoother interactions and minimal visual noise.

Uber Eats maintains good design standards but occasionally struggles with slow response times and redundant payment prompts.

All three platforms can enhance error prevention, confirmation dialogs, and personalized recommendations for frequent users.

### 7. Recommendations

Improve Checkout Flow:
Introduce a clear confirmation step and allow users to easily undo or edit items in the cart.

Enhance ETA Accuracy:
Add a visual progress tracker showing each stage of order delivery (preparing, picked up, on the way, arriving).

Reduce Visual Clutter:
Limit promotional banners on the home screen and move secondary offers into a collapsible “Deals” section.

Consistent Interface:
Use the same color, button placement, and icons across all screens to reduce confusion.

Better Error Handling:
Replace technical error messages with friendly, action-oriented prompts (e.g., “Retry Payment” or “Change Address”).

Personalized Recommendations:
Suggest frequently ordered items or restaurants to improve efficiency and user satisfaction.

### 8. Conclusion

Among the evaluated apps, Swiggy offers the most seamless and consistent user experience, while Zomato excels in visual appeal and brand identity but needs better control features and reduced clutter.
Uber Eats maintains a balanced design but can improve on speed and responsiveness.

Implementing the recommended design changes—particularly in checkout clarity, error prevention, and visual simplification—can significantly improve usability, reduce cart abandonment, and enhance overall customer trust and engagement.

## Result:
Thus, the Heuristic Evaluation of an Existing Website or App is created and verified.
